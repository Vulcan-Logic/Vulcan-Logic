### About me and my coding history
I like programming and I have been programming for over 30 years. 
I have a keen interest in computer programming and I started programming in 1988. It has been a hobby ever since. 
The very first programs I wrote were written for a GW-BASIC interpreter running on an Intel-8088 PC. Following my hobby, 
over the next few years I learnt to programme in COBOL, dBase III+, VP Planner, Lotus 123, Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and C.  
My mathematics degree required me to learn PASCAL while yet another endeavour required me to learn MATLAB.  
Later on, while working for my family business, I wrote small programmes for MS-ACCESS & MS-EXCEL. 
I used JAVA (SWING, JDBC) & PostgreSQL to wrtie a small application for inventory management for the business. 
I also developed an interest in using AUTOCAD for making and managing drawings for the business. I moved from AUTOCAD to Pro-Engineer to make
3D models, finally working with CATIA to make hundreds of 3D models and drawings.
Invited by National Instruments for LABVIEW demonstrations, I also tranied for using LABVIEW.  
Having studied statistics, I developed an interest in data science which led me to the Data Science specialization programme conducted by John Hopkins University and 
Coursera. This gave me skills in R programming and using markdown for hypertext documents. 
Data Science is incomplete without mentioning machine and deep learning which introduced me to Python, a programming language I have come to love.  
I was accepted into the Junior Web Development programme coducted by Academy Xi and Generation Australia and this has imparted me with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript skills. 
Apart from the Junior Web Development programme, I also have certificates from Udacity & Coursera in various web development technologies like REACT, Python and Flask.  
### Repositories in this GitHub A/C. 
This account host repositories for many projects that I have done. 
Some projects were made to fulfill the requirements of the online courses that I was doing while other are related to projects that I did to increase my experience in 
this field. Some are the result of hobby projects.
